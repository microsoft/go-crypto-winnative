The `internal/cryptotest` package provides a set of tests for cryptographic primitives.

`internal/cryptotest` has been copied from the Go standard library's [crypo/internal/cryptotest](https://github.com/golang/go/tree/807e01db4840e25e4d98911b28a8fa54244b8dfa/src/crypto/internal/cryptotest)
package and trimmed down to only include the tests that are relevant for the `openssl` package.
